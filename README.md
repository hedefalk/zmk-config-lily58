# Viktor's Lily58 Qwerty Swedish

Swedish Qwerty for now.

## Issues
- [ ] I'm having problems with the bootloader I think. NiceNano clones from https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006076173222.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.119.4e981802ffEh3T

    On my MacStudio I could never get it up as an USB flash drive, it just disconnects straight after double tapping reset. On the MacBook Air I actually did flash it _a couple_ of times by simply dragging to the usb drive, but now I can't seem to do it anymore.

But when dragging a file over, three things happens at once:

and no update is done :(
